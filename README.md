Trials with CHOMP
=================

You need [CMake][], [Eigen][] v3, and [GTK+][] v2.  Then everything is easy:

    git clone git@github.com:poftwaresatent/trychomp
    mkdir trychomp/build
    cd trychomp/build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./pp2d
    ./pprrr2d

As the name implies, this is based on [CHOMP][].
